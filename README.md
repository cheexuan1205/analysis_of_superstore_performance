# ANALYSIS OF SUPERSTORE PERFORMANCE IN UNITED STATES (US)
This is a small project of analysing the superstore performance in United States (US) using Tableau.

## Executive Summary
The story and the report will only be showing the Superstore Performance in Unites States (US) as I
would like to focus on the analyses in US country. I would also keen to find out what improvements
can be made by US even though the superstore performance in US country was the best compared to
other countries in the world. However, it is still not the best performance in market as the APAC and
EU are leading ahead.

Certainly, it can be due to the geographical area sizes of the market. However, let us see what can
improve in the US country in term of the superstore performance.
In the dashboard 1 of the story, it will be showing the overview of profitability in US and identifying
the most losses state in US. In dashboard 2 of the story, it will be showing the analysis of the most
losses state in US by some “dimensions” in term of several “measures”.
In dashboard 3 of the story, it will be showing customer segment analysis to analyse what are the
things that senior management can make improvement.
In dashboard 4 of the story, it will be showing product category analysis and identifying the most
losses sub-category in US. In dashboard 5 of the story, we could see that what improvement can be
made to minimise the most losses sub-category in US by “dimension” in term of several “measures”.

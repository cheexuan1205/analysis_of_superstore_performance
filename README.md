# ANALYSIS OF SUPERSTORE PERFORMANCE IN UNITED STATES (US)
This is a small project of analysing the superstore performance in United States (US) by using Tableau to create a story (a collection of dashboards). 

The main objectives are to explore the dataset using Tableau's data visualisation tools and create a story which is a collection of few dashboards and describe the key insights from the story, including recommendations to senior management as a result of my discoveries and write it in an individual project work of academic report. From the raw data that I received, I need to spend time exploring, or mining the dataset hoping to discover interesting trends, patterns and relationships.

## Executive Summary
The story and the report will only be showing the Superstore Performance in Unites States (US) as I
would like to focus on the analyses in US country. I would also keen to find out what improvements
can be made by US even though the superstore performance in US country was the best compared to
other countries in the world. However, it is still not the best performance in market as the APAC and
EU are leading ahead.

Certainly, it can be due to the geographical area sizes of the market. However, let us see what can
improve in the US country in term of the superstore performance.
In the dashboard 1 of the story, it will be showing the overview of profitability in US and identifying
the most losses state in US. In dashboard 2 of the story, it will be showing the analysis of the most
losses state in US by some “dimensions” in term of several “measures”.
In dashboard 3 of the story, it will be showing customer segment analysis to analyse what are the
things that senior management can make improvement.
In dashboard 4 of the story, it will be showing product category analysis and identifying the most
losses sub-category in US. In dashboard 5 of the story, we could see that what improvement can be
made to minimise the most losses sub-category in US by “dimension” in term of several “measures”.

## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Superstore Performance Globally
Based on the dataset I received, it is the superstore database of the transactions globally between
year 2011 and year 2014. However, I would like to focus on the analyses in the United States market.

Figure 1, generated from Tableau

From figure 1, based on this dataset, if looking at the total profit of different countries globally
between 2011 and 2014, United States was the most profitable country of superstore, compared to
other countries in the world.

## 2 Overview of Profitability in United States (US)

### 2.1 Overall Superstore Performance in US
From dashboard 1 in the story, I identified the total sales and total profit in US between year 2011 and
year 2014 were $2,297,201 and $286,397 respectively. The total average of discount offered in US for
all category products was 0.1562 which is 15.62%. The total average discount offered in US was
considerably low, I could think that this is one of the reasons why the superstore’s sum of profits in
United States was the highest compared to other countries in the world. I would like to find out more
details to let the superstore performance in US more profitable.
### 2.2 Profit in United States (US) by State
Based on the map and “treemap” from dashboard 1, California was the most profitable state in US
with the total profit of $76,381 between 2011 and 2014, followed by New York, Washington,
Michigan, Virginia, Indiana and other states. The most unprofitable state with the losses of $25,729
was Texas. Therefore, the range of the total profit in US was between -$25,729 and $76,381. In this
case, I would like to find out why Texas was the most losses state in US with the analysis in the second
dashboard.

## 3 Analysis of the Most Losses State in United States

### 3.1 Analysis of the Most Losses State (Texas) by Sub-Category
The second dashboard will be shown about the analysis by sub-category of the most losses state which
is Texas in US. From dashboard 2 with the analysis of Texas by category, overall had losses in furniture
and office supplies but had some profits in technology.
### 3.2 Recommendation
#### 3.2.1 Furniture
From the data in dashboard 2, I could see that all sub-categories in furniture are making losses but the
sale of chairs is the second highest in Texas. With reference to other sub-categories which are not
making losses, the average discounts offered in sub-categories of furniture are obviously higher than
them which only 20% average discount. Therefore, I would suggest that lower the overall discount
offered for all sub-categories in furniture especially the furnishings with 60% of average discount.
#### 3.2.2 Office Supplies
Based on the data in dashboard 2, the obvious problem is the losses in binders and appliances. One
of the reasons for making losses in binders and appliances can be due to surprisingly high average
discount of binders and appliances which is 80% compared to other sub-categories of office supplies
selling with only 20% average discount. Hence, I would recommend that lower the overall discount
offered in Texas for binders and appliances to a standard average discount in order to minimise the
losses.
#### 3.2.3 Technology
I could see that the sale of phones was the highest in Texas. Thus, I would recommend senior
management that can ensure the continuity of promoting and advertising technology in Texas for
phones, copiers and accessories. For machines, it was the third highest sale of sub-category in Texas
but it was making losses. One of the reasons for making losses in machines can be due to higher
average discount of machines which is 40% discount compared to other technologies selling with only
20% average discount. Thus, I would suggest that lower the overall discount offered again for
machines in Texas.
#### 3.2.4 Small Conclusion
The main reason for making losses in Texas could be due to high average discount offered by the
specific sub-category. Therefore, senior management may need to do some adjustments to lower the
average discount offered by the sub-categories who are making losses. By all these actions, I believed
that overall profits in Texas will be increased.

## 4 Customer Segment Analysis

### 4.1 Overall Superstore Performance in United States (US) by Customer Segment
From dashboard 3 in the story, I identified the largest sum of profit in US came from consumer which
the sum of profit is $134,119, followed by corporate and home office. The largest sum of sales in US
also came from consumer which the sum of sale is $1,161,401, followed by corporate and home office.
I would like to find out more details about the customer segment to let the superstore performance
in US more profitable.
### 4.2 Purchase Seasons for Category in United States (US) by Customer Segment
From the area charts in dashboard 3, seasonal time series of purchasing for category in US by customer
segment can be identified. The sum of sales was based on the order date quarter.
### 4.3 Recommendation
Based on the seasonal trend of area charts in dashboard 3, I could clearly see that the purchase season
in US for furniture, office supplies and technology by consumer and corporate was the fourth quarter
of the year, which means in October, November and December. Due to the bigger proportion of sales
and profit in US mainly came from consumers and corporates, I would suggest that can continue to
do promotion and manufacture more category products in the fourth quarter of every year to target
consumer and corporate in order to maximise profit. This is because it would help to boost more
profits in United States. The other suggestions would be lesser the manufacture of products for all
category products in the first quarter of every year to minimise the losses of sluggish sales.

Moreover, the purchase trend for furniture and office supplies by home office was considerably cyclic
patterns which means they will purchase once two years roughly. Therefore, senior management can
ensure that the manufacture of products for furniture and office supplies in the fourth quarter of year
are even more produced to also target the home offices with that specific year. However, the trend
of technology that the home offices bought technologies was also the fourth quarter of the year.
Hence, senior management should ensure the increase in manufacture of technologies year by year
due to the trend with the demand is increasing every year.

## 5 Product Category Analysis

### 5.1 Overall Superstore Performance in United States (US) by Product Category
From dashboard 4 in the story, I identified the largest sum of profit in US came from technology which
the sum of profit is $145,455, followed by office supplies and furniture. The largest sum of sales in US
also came from technology which the sum of sale is $836,154, followed by furniture and office
supplies.
### 5.2 Sub-Category Analysis in United States
From dashboard 4 with the sub-category analysis in US, overall was making profit in furniture, office
supplies and technology. However, it can be better by looking into the details.
### 5.3 Recommendation
#### 5.3.1 Furniture
From the data in dashboard 4, I could see bookcases and tables are making losses. However, the
obvious problem is the loss in tables. With reference to other sub-categories in furniture, the average
discount offered in table is obviously higher than them and median of discount in table is the highest
among all the other sub-category. Therefore, I would suggest that lower the overall discount offered
for tables.
#### 5.3.2 Office Supplies and Technology
The only recommendation is that senior management have to ensure the overall discount for office
supplies and technology in US will not increase much suddenly.

## 6 Analysis of the Most Losses in Sub-Category by State

### 6.1 Sub-Category (Tables) Analysis by State
Table is the most losses among the sub-categories of furniture in US. From dashboard 5, we could
identify the states that were making losses in table sub-category.
### 6.2 Recommendation
With reference to other states which are making profits, the average discounts offered in states which
are making losses are seriously higher than them. The fact was that states which are making profit in
tables with zero average discount. Hence, the reason of states which are making losses in tables must
be due to the average discounts offered. Therefore, I would suggest that senior management could
do some adjustment if possible to lower the overall discount offered for tables in states which are
making losses especially the New York, Illinois and North Carolina. This is because total losses of tables
for each state of them are more than $3,500. I believed that by this suggestion, the overall table profits
will be increased.

## 7 Conclusion
By implementing all the recommendations that I suggested, I believed that overall profits in United
States will be increased and made superstore performance in US market even better than now.

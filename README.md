# ANALYSIS OF SUPERSTORE PERFORMANCE IN UNITED STATES (US)
This is a small project of analysing the superstore performance in United States (US) using Tableau.

## Executive Summary
The story and the report will only be showing the Superstore Performance in Unites States (US) as I
would like to focus on the analyses in US country. I would also keen to find out what improvements
can be made by US even though the superstore performance in US country was the best compared to
other countries in the world. However, it is still not the best performance in market as the APAC and
EU are leading ahead.

Certainly, it can be due to the geographical area sizes of the market. However, let us see what can
improve in the US country in term of the superstore performance.
In the dashboard 1 of the story, it will be showing the overview of profitability in US and identifying
the most losses state in US. In dashboard 2 of the story, it will be showing the analysis of the most
losses state in US by some “dimensions” in term of several “measures”.
In dashboard 3 of the story, it will be showing customer segment analysis to analyse what are the
things that senior management can make improvement.
In dashboard 4 of the story, it will be showing product category analysis and identifying the most
losses sub-category in US. In dashboard 5 of the story, we could see that what improvement can be
made to minimise the most losses sub-category in US by “dimension” in term of several “measures”.

## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Superstore Performance Globally
Based on the dataset I received, it is the superstore database of the transactions globally between
year 2011 and year 2014. However, I would like to focus on the analyses in the United States market.

Figure 1, generated from Tableau

From figure 1, based on this dataset, if looking at the total profit of different countries globally
between 2011 and 2014, United States was the most profitable country of superstore, compared to
other countries in the world.

### 2.1 Overall Superstore Performance in US
From dashboard 1 in the story, I identified the total sales and total profit in US between year 2011 and
year 2014 were $2,297,201 and $286,397 respectively. The total average of discount offered in US for
all category products was 0.1562 which is 15.62%. The total average discount offered in US was
considerably low, I could think that this is one of the reasons why the superstore’s sum of profits in
United States was the highest compared to other countries in the world. I would like to find out more
details to let the superstore performance in US more profitable.
### 2.2 Profit in United States (US) by State
Based on the map and “treemap” from dashboard 1, California was the most profitable state in US
with the total profit of $76,381 between 2011 and 2014, followed by New York, Washington,
Michigan, Virginia, Indiana and other states. The most unprofitable state with the losses of $25,729
was Texas. Therefore, the range of the total profit in US was between -$25,729 and $76,381. In this
case, I would like to find out why Texas was the most losses state in US with the analysis in the second
dashboard.
